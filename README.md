# Rock-Mountain

These are data collected after the Rock Mountain wildfire in 2016. There are four data files in this repository: 

1. Litter decomposition. These show the proportion of mass remaining from litterbags containing either AM or ECM litter over 3 years. 
2. Soil macroinvertebrate communities. These are summed macroinvertebrates collected over 3 seasons in 2018. 
3. Mesoinvertebrates extracted from litterbags. These are abundances of mesoinvertebrates extracted from litterbags. 
4. Soil dissolved inorganic nitrogen concentrations. These are dissolved inorganic nitrogen concentrations from soils at 3 depths.
