# Rock-Mountain

These are data collected after the Rock Mountain wildfire of 2016 in the Southern Appalachian Mountains.  Data were collected over four spatial blocks and four topographic positions.

There are five data files in this repository: 

1. rock_mountain_litter.csv shows the proportion of mass remaining from litterbags containing either AM or ECM litter over 3 years. 

2. rock_mountain_summed_macroinvertebrates_per_sq_m.csv contains abundances (summed over 3 seasons in 2018) of macroinvertebrates collected from either litter or soil that are expressed per square meter. 

3. rock_mountain_mesoinvertebrates.csv contains abundances of springtails and mites extracted from some litterbags (described above).
 
4. rock_mountain_DIN.csv contains soil dissolved inorganic nitrogen concentrations that were sampled at 3 depths during 3 seasons in 2018. 

5. rock_mountain_worms_per_sq_m.csv contains abundances of adult and subadult earthworms that were further identified to family.
