These are data collected after the Rock Mountain wildfire in 2016 in the Southern Appalachian Mountains.  There are four data files in this repository: 

1. Litter decomposition. These show the proportion of mass remaining from litterbags containing either AM or ECM litter over 3 years. 

2. rock_mountain_summed_macroinvertebrates_per_sq_m.csv contains summed abundances of macroinvertebrates collected over 3 seasons in 2018 that are expressed per square meter. 
3. Mesoinvertebrates extracted from litterbags. These are abundances of mesoinvertebrates extracted from litterbags. 
4. Soil dissolved inorganic nitrogen concentrations. These are dissolved inorganic nitrogen concentrations from soils at 3 depths.
